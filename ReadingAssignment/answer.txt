Q1 (Part 9): Both Cart and Store are the aggregate of Media, while CompactDisc is the aggregate of Track.
Q2 (Part 10): If the object passed in the method is not an instance of Media, the equals() method returns false.
Q3 (Part 11): The polymorphism sample code program will run normally, each object (CD, DVD, BOOK) will be printed by it's toString() method in their separate objects.
The reasion is that because Book, CompactDisc and DigitalVideoDisc inherit Media, so objects book, cd, dvd are also instances of Media. 

Q4 (Part 12): The Media Class should implements Comparable interface.
Q5 (Part 12): The compareTo() method needs to return a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer if the current object is respectively "smaller", equal to, or "greater" than the specified object.
Q6 (Part 12). No since Comparable interface is used for internal comparison and can be implemented only once by class Media.
Q7 (Part 12). I would modify my code to perform that required task by overriding compareTo() method in DigitalVideoDisc class.
